Translating the network meets the 72 FPS	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average of all the frames is the most important value to look at because it can give us an idea of whether the experiment meets the required FPS or not. In a perfect application where all the frames last the same amount of time and where the frame rate is 72, each frame would last around 13.9 milliseconds. However, this is not the case in real applications. If the general average is above 13.9 milliseconds, it means that the experiment didn't pass the 72 FPS. By looking at the 0.25\\% worst frame time and the 1\\% worst frame time, we will get the frame with the worst time and the 7 frames with the worst times respectively (our experiments last for 700 frames). If we see that these frames have much worse times, compared with the general average, we will use a profiler to see if there are bottlenecks and try to give a solution to them.$/;"	subsubsection	line:122
Selecting nodes the network meets the 72 FPS but with possible bottlenecks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average time for this experiment is also under the 13.9 milliseconds limit, meaning that the interaction reaches 72 FPS. The low 1\\% is also under 13.9 milliseconds, so we don't consider that there are any big issues for the performance of this interaction. The variation among the network sizes is also insignificant. An evaluation with bigger networks would be necessary to determine the network size limit for which the performance is not good.$/;"	subsubsection	line:165
What network properties influence the scalability	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^One important observation is that in the experiment we just select 7 nodes, one every 100 frames. However, when we use GeneNete VR, it's easy to select many nodes in just a few frames. This is because the select node function is run for every frame when we trigger the action for it, and if we point at a region where there are many nodes together, it will be easy to select several of them in a short period of time. Also, not all nodes have the same number of edges. It would be interesting to know if the number of edges could decrease the performance as well. We will analyze in the following section if the number of edges could have more impact on the performance and scalability of the network.$/;"	section	line:260
Do we achieve the recommended FPS 72 for large biological networks when using the standalone Oculus Quest	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^It's hard to determine from the experiments that we ran if the number of edges can have an impact on the scalability of the system. We would need to better isolate this part of the code and further evaluate it. However, we expect that the number of edges can have an impact. As we have mentioned before, a better implementation solution could improve the performance of this. Instead of creating the edges in the scene every time a node is selected, we can create all the necessary edges in the initialization of the system, and show them when they are needed. So, normally they would be hidden, but we show them when the user selects a node.$/;"	section	line:312
How do you perceive the application for pattern finding	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^During the interviews, we also asked if using a standalone headset like the Oculus Quest is advantageous. Respondents 1 and 5 respondents said that it is. The reason why it is advantageous is that it is easier to use since you don't need cables and you can also stand and use it anywhere you want. It is also easy if you can walk around in order to explore the network, according to respondent 5. On the other hand, two respondents (2 and 3) claimed that they prefer to use this kind of visualization tool while sitting. The rest of the respondents didn't consider it relevant.$/;"	subsubsection	line:406
