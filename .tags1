Translating the network meets the 72 FPS	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average of all the frames is the most important value to look at because it can give us an idea of whether the experiment meets the required FPS or not. In a perfect application where all the frames last the same amount of time and where the frame rate is 72, each frame would last around 13.9 milliseconds. However, this is not the case in real applications. If the general average is above 13.9 milliseconds, it means that the experiment didn't pass the 72 FPS. By looking at the 0.25\\% worst frame time and the 1\\% worst frame time, we will get the frame with the worst time and the 7 frames with the worst times respectively (our experiments last for 700 frames). If we see that these frames have much worse times, compared with the general average, we will use a profiler to see if there are bottlenecks and try to give a solution to them.$/;"	subsubsection	line:122
Selecting nodes the network meets the 72 FPS but with possible bottlenecks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average time for this experiment is also under the 13.9 milliseconds limit, meaning that the interaction reaches 72 FPS. The low 1\\% is also under 13.9 milliseconds, so we don't consider that there are any big issues for the performance of this interaction. The variation among the network sizes is also insignificant. An evaluation with bigger networks would be necessary to determine the network size limit for which the performance is not good.$/;"	subsubsection	line:165
What network properties influence the scalability	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^One important observation is that in the experiment we just select 7 nodes, one every 100 frames. However, when we use GeneNete VR, it's easy to select many nodes in just a few frames. This is because the select node function is run for every frame when we trigger the action for it, and if we point at a region where there are many nodes together, it will be easy to select several of them in a short period of time. Also, not all nodes have the same number of edges. It would be interesting to know if the number of edges could decrease the performance as well. We will analyze in the following section if the number of edges could have more impact on the performance and scalability of the network.$/;"	section	line:260
How do users perceive the visualization of large biological networks in GeneNet VR	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^From the results, we can say that we reach 72 FPS using the Oculus Quest for our network size. However, the performance is on the limit of 72 FPS and when we select nodes with more than 10 edges, the performance can get worse. It would be necessary to evaluate GeneNet VR using larger networks on the Oculus Quest. Also improve the creation of the edges as a better programming solution, as we mentioned before.$/;"	section	line:359
How do you perceive the application	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^\\end{table}$/;"	subsubsection	line:390
What is missing in the application	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^We also received some feedback about how to improve the visualization for pattern finding. For example, it would be useful to show the names of the connected nodes to the node that we are selecting. Also, the possibility to isolate or highlight the nodes that we are selecting would be helpful. Finally, pattern finding would also be easier if they had the chance to change the layout of the network.$/;"	subsubsection	line:404
