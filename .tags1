Challenges and research problem	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/introduction.tex	/^\\textbf{Thesis statement: } \\emph{Virtual Reality is advantageous for the visualization of large biological networks and for rapid exploration of patterns in them using affordable hardware}.$/;"	section	line:36
Proposed solution and contribution	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/introduction.tex	/^The interactivity in VR is usually done with the VR controllers, which simulate our hands in the virtual world. We can implement natural actions for the operator such as grabbing objects or items with their hands, which will feel intuitive. However, we can also implement other actions in the virtual world like using laser pointers to select something, using 2D menus inside the virtual world or teleporting the user to other parts of the virtual space. In GeneNet VR, we are dealing with abstract information and the amount of data can escalate quickly if we do not implement practical solutions. We must therefore maintain a proper balance between the amount of data being visualized, comfort and user-friendly interaction solutions and good performance.$/;"	section	line:71
