For which interactions do we achieve the recommended FPS 72 for large biological networks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^To evaluate the quality of GeneNet VR, we conducted a series of interviews with several employees from UiT involved in computer science and biology research projects. These interviews were conducted in an informal way and have the purpose of obtaining feedback about aspects like the research contribution in bioinformatics, the performance of the application and the interactions, the usability and also improvements that can be done to the project.$/;"	section	line:119
Scaling the network meets the 72 FPS	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The averages for all the sizes are below 13.9 milliseconds, so translating the blood dataset network meets the 72 FPS. There isn't a significant difference between the averages for the different network sizes. This is because the network that we are using is probably too small. It would be interesting to use larger networks to find out for which network size the performance is no longer good enough.$/;"	subsubsection	line:150
Selecting nodes the network meets the 72 FPS but with possible bottlenecks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average time for this experiment is also under the 13.9 milliseconds limit, meaning that the interaction reaches the 72 FPS. The low 1\\% is also under the 13.9 milliseconds, so we don't consider that there are any big issues for the performance of this interaction. The variation among the network sizes is also insignificant. An evaluation with bigger networks would be necessary to determine the network size limit for which the performance is not good.$/;"	subsubsection	line:171
What network properties influence the scalability	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^One important observation is that in the experiment we just select 7 nodes, one every 100 frame. However, when we use GeneNete VR, it's easy to select many nodes in just a few frames. This is because the select node function is run for every frame when we trigger the action for it, and if we point at a region where there are many nodes together, it will be easy to select several of them in a short period of time. Also, not all the nodes have the same number of edges. It would be interesting to know if the number of edges could decrease the performance as well. We will analyse in the following section if the number of edges could have more impact in the performance and scalability of the network.$/;"	section	line:304
How do users perceive the visualization of large biological networks in GeneNet VR	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^We can extract from the experiment that we can use GeneNet VR for the network sizes that we used from MIxT and that we achieve the 72 FPS. However, the performance is on the limit of the 72 FPS and when we select nodes with more than 10 edges, the performance can be bad during that frame. It would be necessary evaluate the performance of GeneNet VR using larger networks on the Oculus Quest. Also improve the creationg of the edges as we mentioned before.$/;"	section	line:403
