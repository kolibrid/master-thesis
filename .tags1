Performance and scalability of the system	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^To profile the application we used the built-in profiler in Unity, the software used for the development. The Unity Profiler gives information about per-fram CPU and GPU performance metrics.$/;"	section	line:124
First part performance	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^I will describe now the experiments that I want to run to evaluate this. The experiments will be divided in two parts. The first part consists of several experiments where I analyze the performance for each of the actions that I will focus on. The second part will focus on analyzing the scalability for the line creation, which can create bottlenecks, according to the performance analysis done.$/;"	subsubsection	line:130
