Scalable network in Unity and data structures	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^Finally, our dataset has information about the relationships between the nodes. GeneNet VR is implemented to show also this information. Because there can be too many relationships in the dataset, we don't show them all at the same time. Therefore, we can only see those of the node that the user has selected. The way that these relationships are represented is with lines between the nodes.$/;"	section	line:100
Other features of GeneNet VR	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^The algorithm used to cluster the nodes in the network is another important aspect that can influence in the scalability. In GeneNet VR we use a linear algorithm that clusters the nodes in the 3d space depending on the module where they belong too. In this way the user can visualize each module as single clusters with a distinct colour per cluster.$/;"	section	line:165

Architecture and design	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^Unity (version 2018.4.10f1 \\cite{unity2018}) is the software that was used to build the system. It is a multi-platform game engine. It is known to be easy to use and for having a big community of creators and asset designers \\cite{developing_vr_unity}. Even though it is intuitive to use, it also has low-level access for developers. As for Virtual Reality, Unity has been up-to-date with the new VR technologies thanks to professionals and amateurs in this area who have built an integration for Unity. In our case, our device is an Oculus Quest, and for this reason we use the Oculus integration for Unity \\cite{oculus_unity_integration}. In addition, we have used VRTK, a collection of scripts and assets that help build VR solutions \\cite{vrtk_what}. Finally, the programming language used in Unity to implement the system is C\\#.$/;"	section	line:224
