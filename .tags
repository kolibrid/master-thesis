Other features of the network	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/bignetvr.tex	/^The algorithm used to cluster the nodes in the network is another important aspect that can influence in the scalability. In BigNet VR we use a linear algorithm that clusters the nodes in the 3d space depending on their module. In this way the user can visualize each module as a cluster of nodes with a distinct colour.$/;"	section	line:157

Switching dataset	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/bignetvr.tex	/^We have built a 2 dimensional menu in Unity, see Figure \\ref{fig:filtering}, to filter the data in our example network. We use checkboxes for the filtering. From a starting point, all the boxes are checked, and if the user wants to hide a part from the visualization it is done by unchecking the box. To show the filtering menu we need to press on the menu botton from the left controller, see the "2. Filter menu" in Figure \\ref{fig:oculus_quest_inputs}. The to check or uncheck the boxes we need to use the A botton from the right controller, named "6. Select item", see Figure \\ref{fig:oculus_quest_inputs}.$/;"	subsubsection	line:173
Implementation details	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/bignetvr.tex	/^Finally BigNet VR has also the possibility to switch between datasets. This can be done in the filtering menu by pressing the menu button from the left controller and there we can see a slider UI element as in Figure \\ref{fig:filtering} which we can move to the right or to the left in order to change the dataset that is being visualized. When we switch the dataset, the filters are also reset to their default state, so all of them will be checked in our example. In our bioinformatic usecase we can switch from the blood dataset to the biopsy one.$/;"	section	line:176
Architecture and design	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/bignetvr.tex	/^Unity (version 2018.4.10f1\\cite{unity2018}) is the software that was used to build the system. Unity is a multi-platform game engine. It is known to be easy to use and for having a big community of creators and asset designers\\cite{developing_vr_unity}. Even though it is intuitive to use, it also has a low-level access for developers. As for Virtual Reality, Unity has been up-to-date with the new VR technologies thanks to professionals and amateurs in this area who have built integrations for Unity. In our case, our device is an Oculus Quest, and for this reason we use the Oculus integration for Unity\\cite{oculus_unity_integration}. In addition we have used VRTK, a collection of ascripts and assets that help build VR solutions\\cite{vrtk_what}. Finally, the programming language used in Unity to implement the system is C\\#.$/;"	section	line:179
