Scalable network in Unity and data structures	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/bignetvr.tex	/^Finally, our dataset has information about the relationships between the nodes. BigNet VR is implemented to show also this information. Because there can be too many relationships in the dataset, we don't show them all at the same time. Therefore we can only see those of the node that the user has selected. The way that these relationships are represented is with lines between the nodes.$/;"	section	line:100
Other features of BigNet VR	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/bignetvr.tex	/^The algorithm used to cluster the nodes in the network is another important aspect that can influence in the scalability. In BigNet VR we use a linear algorithm that clusters the nodes in the 3d space depending on the module where they belong too. In this way the user can visualize each module as single clusters with a distinct colour per cluster.$/;"	section	line:165
Performance and scalability of the system	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^To profile the application we used the built-in profiler in Unity, the software used for the development.

First part performance	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^I will describe now the experiments that I want to run to evaluate this. The experiments will be divided in two parts. The first part consists of several experiments where I analyze the performance for each of the actions that I will focus on. The second part will focus on analyzing the scalability for the line creation, which can create bottlenecks, according to the performance analysis done.$/;"	subsubsection	line:130
