Network characteristics	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/mixt.tex	/^We have added the possibility to compare two datasets in real-time in GeneNet VR.

To compare two networks, the user can use a UI slider to visualize two datasets at the same time, creating what we call a morphing effect. To help the user distinguish from one dataset to another, we use linear interpolation for both the color of the nodes and their position.$/;"	section	line:39

Proposed solution and contribution	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/introduction.tex	/^The interactivity in VR is usually done with the VR controllers, which simulate our hands in the virtual world. We can implement natural actions for the operator such as grabbing objects or items with their hands, which will feel intuitive. However, we can also implement other actions in the virtual world like using laser pointers to select something, using 2D menus inside the virtual world or teleporting the user to other parts of the virtual space. In GeneNet VR, we are dealing with abstract information and the amount of data can escalate quickly if we do not implement practical solutions. We must therefore maintain a proper balance between the amount of data being visualized, comfort and user-friendly interaction solutions and good performance.$/;"	section	line:71

Translating the network meets the 72 FPS	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average of all the frames is the most important value to look at because it can give us an idea of whether the experiment meets the required FPS or not. In a perfect application where all the frames last the same amount of time and where the frame rate is 72, each frame would last around 13.9 milliseconds. However, this is not the case in real applications. If the general average is above 13.9 milliseconds, it means that the experiment didn't pass the 72 FPS. By looking at the 0.25\\% worst frame time and the 1\\% worst frame time, we will get the frame with the worst time and the 7 frames with the worst times respectively (our experiments last for 700 frames). If we see that these frames have much worse times, compared with the general average, we will use a profiler to see if there are bottlenecks and try to give a solution to them.$/;"	subsubsection	line:122
Selecting nodes the network meets the 72 FPS but with possible bottlenecks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average time for this experiment is also under the 13.9 milliseconds limit, meaning that the interaction reaches 72 FPS. The low 1\\% is also under 13.9 milliseconds, so we don't consider that there are any big issues for the performance of this interaction. The variation among the network sizes is also insignificant.
