BigNet VR is implemented to show also this information. Because there can be too many relationships in the dataset, we don't show them all at the same time.

Architecture and design	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^Unity (version 2018.4.10f1 \\cite{unity2018}) is the software that was used to build the system. It is a multi-platform game engine. It is known to be easy to use and for having a big community of creators and asset designers \\cite{developing_vr_unity}. Even though it is intuitive to use, it also has low-level access for developers. As for Virtual Reality, Unity has been up-to-date with the new VR technologies thanks to professionals and amateurs in this area who have built an integration for Unity. In our case, our device is an Oculus Quest, and for this reason we use the Oculus integration for Unity \\cite{oculus_unity_integration}. In addition, we have used VRTK, a collection of scripts and assets that help build VR solutions \\cite{vrtk_what}. Finally, the programming language used in Unity to implement the system is C\\#.$/;"	section	line:224
