Architecture and design	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^Unity (version 2018.4.10f1 \\cite{unity2018}) is the software that was used to build the system. It is a multi-platform game engine. It is known to be easy to use and for having a big community of creators and asset designers \\cite{developing_vr_unity}. Even though it is intuitive to use, it also has low-level access for developers. As for Virtual Reality, Unity has been up-to-date with the new VR technologies thanks to professionals and amateurs in this area who have built an integration for Unity. In our case, our device is an Oculus Quest, and for this reason we use the Oculus integration for Unity \\cite{oculus_unity_integration}. In addition, we have used VRTK, a collection of scripts and assets that help build VR solutions \\cite{vrtk_what}.

Proposed solution and contribution	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/introduction.tex	/^The interactivity in VR is usually done with the VR controllers, which simulate our hands in the virtual world. We can implement natural actions for the operator such as grabbing objects or items with their hands, which will feel intutive. But we can also implement other actions in the virtual world like using laser pointers to select something, using 2D menus inside the virtual world or teleporting the user to other parts of the virtual space. In GeneNet VR, we are dealing with abstract information and the amount of data can escalate quickly if we don't implement practical solutions. We therefore need to keep a good balance between the amount of data that is being visualized, comfort and user-friendly interaction solutions and good performance.$/;"	section	line:71

For which interactions do we achieve the recommended FPS 72 for large biological networks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^To evaluate the quality of GeneNet VR, we conducted a series of interviews with several employees from UiT involved in computer science and biology research projects. These interviews were conducted in an informal way and have the purpose of obtaining feedback about aspects like the research contribution in bioinformatics, the performance of the application and the interactions, the usability and also improvements that can be done to the project.$/;"	section	line:113
Scaling the network meets the 72 FPS	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The averages for all the sizes are below 13.9 milliseconds, so translating the blood dataset network meets the 72 FPS. There isn't a significant difference between the averages for the different network sizes. This is because the network that we are using is probably too small. It would be interesting to use larger networks to find out for which network size the performance is no longer good enough.$/;"	subsubsection	line:144
Selecting nodes the network meets the 72 FPS but with possible bottlenecks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^The average time for this experiment is also under the 13.9 milliseconds limit, meaning that the interaction reaches the 72 FPS. The low 1\\% is also under the 13.9 milliseconds, so we don't consider that there are any big issues for the performance of this interaction. The variation among the network sizes is also insignificant. An evaluation with bigger networks would be necessary to determine the network size limit for which the performance is not good.$/;"	subsubsection	line:165
What network properties influence the scalability	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^One important observation is that in the experiment we just select 7 nodes, one every 100 frame. However, when we use GeneNete VR, it's easy to select many nodes in just a few frames. This is because the select node function is run for every frame when we trigger the action for it, and if we point at a region where there are many nodes together, it will be easy to select several of them in a short period of time. Also, not all the nodes have the same number of edges. It would be interesting to know if the number of edges could decrease the performance as well. We will analyse in the following section if the number of edges could have more impact in the performance and scalability of the network.$/;"	section	line:297
How do users perceive the visualization of large biological networks in GeneNet VR	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/evaluation.tex	/^From the results we can say that we reach the 72 FPS using the Oculus Quest for our network size. However, the performance is on the limit of the 72 FPS and when we select nodes with more than 10 edges, the performance can be get worse. It would be necessary to evaluate GeneNet VR using larger networks on the Oculus Quest. Also improve the creationg of the edges as a better programming solution, as we mentioned before.$/;"	section	line:396
