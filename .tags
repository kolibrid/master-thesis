Architecture and design	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^Unity (version 2018.4.10f1\\cite{unity2018}) is the software that was used to build the system. It is a multi-platform game engine. It is known to be easy to use and for having a big community of creators and asset designers\\cite{developing_vr_unity}. Even though it is intuitive to use, it also has a low-level access for developers. As for Virtual Reality, Unity has been up-to-date with the new VR technologies thanks to professionals and amateurs in this area who have built integrations for Unity. In our case, our device is an Oculus Quest, and for this reason we use the Oculus integration for Unity\\cite{oculus_unity_integration}. In addition we have used VRTK, a collection of ascripts and assets that help build VR solutions\\cite{vrtk_what}. Finally, the programming language used in Unity to implement the system is C\\#.$/;"	section	line:224
Discussion	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^For the \\textit{Teleportation and snap rotation component} we have used some scripts and prefabs that come with the VRTK library.

VR toolkits and frameworks	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^I chose Unity for the development mostly because I had some experience with it. In addition when I researched about VR development, I found that Unity is good integrated with Oculus Quest and there is the VRTK library. I also found several tutorials about VR development in Unity as well as documentation for the Oculus integration and about VRTK. Unity is also known to be easier to learn. There is a study where they teach Unity and Unreal Engine to students and they conclude that Unity is little less complicated to learn\\cite{unity_vs_unreal}. On the other hand Unreal can create more professional looking results. However we are not looking to have realistic graphics in our application since we are dealing with abstract data.$/;"	subsubsection	line:297
VR headsets	/Users/alvaromartinezfernandez/Documents/UiT/Masteroppgave/thesis/chapters/genenetvr.tex	/^Apart from the Oculus integration for Unity, there are some 3rd party toolkits that we can use to develop VR experiences for Oculus Quest. I used VRTK in my project, as I have mentioned before. This toolkit contains several scripts and prefabs that can be used to accelerate the development process for VR. In my case I used this library to build the teleportation and snap rotation locomotion techniques. Vr Interaction Framework\\footnote{http:\/\/beardedninjagames.com\/vr-framework} is another toolkit for VR development, but it is not free. In addition, Unity comes with XR, a support for XR platform integrations.$/;"	subsubsection	line:301
