\begin{abstract}
The visualization of large amounts of biological data can be challenging. Network representations are ususally preferred for some biological datasets; but they face problems like information overload, high interconnectivity and high dimensionality. Some visualization tools try to solve these problems by reducing the interactivity in favour of more information or by using specific hardware. This thesis aims to improve these problems using Virtual Reality (VR) and the Oculus Quest, an affordable VR headset.

In order to test our hypthesis that Virtual Reality can be advantageous in the visualization of large biological networks, we built GeneNet VR, a prototype for the Oculus Quest. We created a case study where we used two gene networks from MIxT, a real application with visualization issues. A performance and scalability evaluation was carried out in addition to a qualitative research approach where we conducted purposive sampling with in-depth semi-structured interviews with several research scientists from UiT. The results showed that the performance for the datasets from our use case reaches the 72 FPS required by Oculus and that GeneNet VR scales well for those network sizes. Oculus Quest is therefore an affordable solution for the visualization of large datasets. From the interviews we also learned that GeneNet VR has potential as a visualization tool and that VR demonstrates benefits for pattern finding in complex networks. GeneNet VR has also shown to be easy to use even for novice VR users. We also gathered interesting feedback and knowledge for further improvements that we can apply not only for biological networks but also in other fields like drug and social networks.

From the results we can say that Virtual Reality has the capability to solve common problems for the visualization of large biological networks. The rich interactivity that VR offers can compensate the large amounts of data. With the advancement in hardware, VR headsets have also become more resourceful and economical. Thus, VR hardware like the Oculus Quest, should be considered as an competitive solution for visualization tools, as described in this thesis.
