\begin{abstract}
Biological data is often visualized as networks. However, they face problems such as information overload, high interconnectivity and high dimensionality. Existing approaches try to solve these problems by reducing the interactivity in favor of more information or by using specific hardware. This thesis aims to solve these problems using Virtual Reality (VR) and the Oculus Quest, an affordable VR headset. Thanks to the rich interactivity that VR offers and the advancements in hardware, we can reduce the amount of information in favor of more interactivity.

In order to test our hypothesis that Virtual Reality can be advantageous in the visualization of large biological networks, we built GeneNet VR, a prototype of a VR application for the Oculus Quest. As a case study, we used two gene networks from MIxT, a real application with visualization issues. We evaluated the performance and scalability of GeneNet VR and we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with several research scientists to evaluate the quality of the application.

The results showed that the performance of GeneNet VR for the datasets from our use case reaches the 72 FPS required by the Oculus' performance guidelines and that GeneNet VR scales well for the largest dataset with 2693 nodes. We also evaluated the performance of GeneNet VR on the Oculus Quest hardware, which also reached the established limit of 72 FPS from Oculus. The Oculus Quest is therefore an affordable option for the visualization of large datasets. From the interviews, we also learned that GeneNet VR has potential as a visualization tool for large biological networks and that is easy to use even for novice VR users. Thus, VR hardware like the Oculus Quest should be considered a competitive solution for visualization tools, as described in this thesis.
