	Abstract = {Single-cell RNAseq is a powerful tool for the dissection of cell populations. Multiple dimension reduction (DR) tools are available to project cells on to 3-dimensional space that allow one to visualise the heterogeneity within the assayed population, often forming complex cellular maps. Thus far, visualisation methods for 3D embedded maps are poor, and the lack of intuitive point/cell selection often hinders a rapid exploration of finer details contained in the data. Moreover, directly comparing the output from several DR methods is not possible. Here we present CellexalVR (www.cellexalvr.med.lu.se), a feature-rich, fully interactive virtual reality environment for the visualisation and analysis of single-cell RNAseq experiments that allows re-searchers to intuitively and collaboratively gain an understanding of their data.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: Metabolic networks combine metabolism and regulation. These complex networks are difficult to understand and visualize due to the amount and diverse types of information that need to be represented. For example, pathway information gives indications of interactions. Experimental data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data, give snapshots of the system state. Stereoscopic virtual environments provide a true three-dimensional representation of metabolic networks, which can be intuitively manipulated, and may help to manage the data complexity.Results: MetNet3D, a 3D virtual reality system, allows a user to explore gene expression and metabolic pathway data simultaneously. Normalized gene expression data are processed in R and visualized as a 3D plot. Users can find a particular gene of interest or a cluster of genes that behave similarly and see how these genes function in metabolic networks from MetNetDB, a database of Arabidopsis metabolic networks, using animated network graphs. Interactive virtual reality, with its enhanced ability to display more information, makes such integration more effective by abstracting key relationships.Availability: MetNet3D and some sample datasets are available at http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/research/sites/metnet/Download/Download.htmContact:julied@iastate.eduSupplementary information: Color snapshots and movies are available at http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/research/sites/metnet/Bioinformatics/SupplementaryInformation.htm}",
