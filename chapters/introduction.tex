It is very cheap nowadays to produce data and many people are doing it due to technological advancement. Just as an example, in the field of genomics, the sequencing of the first human genome (2002) took around 13 years and cost over \$3 million to complete. Now we can sequence hundreds of genomes in a few days\cite{big_biological_impacts_bd}. This leads to the accumulation of vast quantities of genomic data, which can be used for new scientific discoveries, diagnose of rare diseases, etc. However we still need a human expert to visually inspect the data to find new signals and discover interesting patterns or to set a diagnosis. No matter how much resources we use into extracting the data if we don't get anything interesting out of it\cite{zhang_paciorkowski_craig_cui_2019}. Therefore there is a great need for new and better tools to support this task.

Some of the main problems that researchers face when analysing genomic data are information overload, data interconnectivity and high dimensionality. One way to deal with all this data is to invent novel analysis. However we still need visual inspection of the data, so the information overload still remains as an important challenge and this is what we attempt to solve. For this reason it is very important to implement efficient visualization technologies that can lead to find new patterns and the extraction of good conclusions of the data. In the field of system biology there are usually network representations where the nodes or bioentities are connected to each other, where these edges represent associations. Networks can increase dramatically in size and complexity and this is due to computational power to create very large networks, scientific knowledge about large networks and the big amounts of data that we have to analyze. We need therefore better visualization systems for the analysis and inspection of these networks.

In Figure \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} we can see a representation of the evolution for visualization of networks in system biology. Before the computers, networks were represented in 2 dimensions and they were static representations that lacked interactivity, see Figure \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} A. With the computer era and the advancement in computer graphics, 3D representations were possible, with the addition of interactivity with the network (See Figure  \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} C). As computer science progressed, there was a big improvement in visualization and also new technologies emerged like virtual reality, which has a huge potential with regards to the interactivity (Figure \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} I).

We believe that virtual reality (VR) can offer new possibilities for visual inspection in large networks. Even though VR is still a field under exploration, it has been demonstrated that it help scientists work more effectively in fields like medicine \cite{Laver11}\cite{xia_ip_samman_wong_gateno_wang_yeung_kot_tideman_2001}\cite{brain_damage_rehab}, biology\cite{10.1093/bioinformatics/bti581}\cite{thorley_lawson_duca_shapiro_2008} and neuroscience\cite{bohil_alicea_biocca_2011}\cite{minderer_harvey_donato_moser_2016}, to  cite some examples. VR can be very powerful because it takes advantage of the way the human being perceives and analysis things. We have a great ability to discover patterns, however we are biologically optimized to see the world and the patterns in 3 dimensions. Some of the advantages that VR has over non-VR approaches are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Visualization of the network in a 3D space.
  \item Possibility to move around the virtual environment and visualize the network from different perspectives as in real life.
  \item Interaction with the the environment by using controllers and our virtual hands in the virtual world.
\end{enumerate}

We have implemented a virtual reality application for the visualization of 3-dimensional networks of data. We have used  up-to-date virtual reality techniques that we think it improves the visualization of this type of data structures. The techniques that we have used consist in: the exploration of the network by moving around the virtual space, making it easier for the user to see the network from different angles; interaction with the network and nodes to comprehend better the data that is being visualized; and the use of 2-dimensional user interfaces to filter and have more control of the data.

What did we learn... [Write when the evaluation is finished].

\section{Challenges and research problem}
This project focus mainly on solving the problem of visualization of high dimenasional data from the MIxT project by using virtual reality. Furthermore the application allows the user to interact with the network created from the data in the virtual environment. It also allows the user compare the blood and biopsy networks at the same time in order to finde relationship, which wasn't possible in the MIxT web application as this only allows the user to visualize one network at a time.

MIxT\cite{fjukstad_dumeaux_olsen_lund_hallett_bongo_2017} is a web application for bioinformaticians. Among other tools, it offers a network visualization of genes which are represented as nodes in the network and where the edges represent statistically significant correlation in expression between two nodes. This tool was used in a study\cite{dumeaux_fjukstad_interactions_tumor_blood} that identifies genes and pathways in the primary tumor that are tightly linked to genes and pathways in the systemic response of a patient with breast cancer.
When exploring a network in MIxT, it can be hard to understand the data and its relationships because there is too much data. This problem is easy to occur when there are too many node and edges. In figure \ref{fig:mixt_network} we can see an example of the network visualization from MIxT. As we can see in Figure \ref{fig:mixt_network1}, there are many nodes and relationships among them and when we zoom in in the network, it becomes very difficult to understand the data and the relationships as shown in in Figure \ref{fig:mixt_network_zoom}.

 The network is also in 2-dimensions and what we propose in this project is to use a virtual reality 3d visualization in order to cope better with this problem.
