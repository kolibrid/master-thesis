In Figure \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} we can see a representation of the evolution for visualization of networks in system biology. Before the computers, networks were represented in 2 dimensions and they were static representations that lacked interactivity, see Figure \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} A. With the computer era and the advancement in computer graphics, 3D representations were possible, with the addition of interactions (See Figure  \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} C). As computer science progressed, visualization improved and also new technologies emerged like virtual reality, which has a huge potential with regards to the interactivity (Figure \ref{fig:network_biology_evolution} I).
