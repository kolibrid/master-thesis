GeneNet VR has been developed to explore biological networks that contain genetic information. For this project, we have used two datasets from MIxT \cite{dumeaux_fjukstad_interactions_tumor_blood}, where we applied several VR techniques to build a visualization and interaction system. In this chapter we want to evaluate GeneNet VR, focusing on its scalability and performance. Since we are visualizing networks with genetic information, we want to know if the system that we built can be used for larger sizes of this type of datasets. As part of the evaluation process, we designed a list of questions that we will try to answer along this chapter. The questions are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For which interactions do we achieve the recommended FPS (72) when scaling the network?
  \item What characteristics of the network influence the scalability?
  \item What is the performance by using a PC with Oculus Link and the performance using just the Quest hardware?
  % \item Bonus: how will “beautifications” influence scalability?
  \item How do users perceive the interaction of the network?
\end{enumerate}

Question one is based on the Oculus' performance guidelines\cite{oculus_performance_baselines}, that say that an application should meet the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 72 FPS for Oculus Quest (required by Oculus).
  \item 50-100 draw calls per frame.
  \item 50,000-100,000 triangles or vertices per frame.
\end{itemize}

We will evaluate the performance for the interactions we use most for the visualization of the networks. These are: translation of the network, scaling of the network and node selection (including the line rendering for the relationships).

As for the second question, we want to know what characteristics influence the scalability of the system. Some parts of the application will have more impact on the performance than others. To keep it simple, we will evaluate the impact in the performance done by the following elements, that are the most important for the visualization: number of nodes,  number of lines and number of clusters. However, since the cluster algorithm is applied when initializing the network, we will just focus on the number of nodes and the number of lines.

We will also evaluate the performance of the application being run in the Oculus Quest hardware and compare it with the performance in the PC. The hardware of the Oculus Quest is not as powerful as the one of the machine that was used for the development. We would like to know if the performance in the Oculus Headset is good enough for the visualization of MIxT.

Finally, we want to know how the users perceive the interaction and visualization of the network. We will evaluate this with a qualitative method with a demo of the application using the MIxT datasets and also an interview.

\section{Experimentation plan}
An experimentation plan was designed to ensure that the experiments are consistent and that they can be reproduced several times in order to get realistic measurements. We take into consideration the following aspects for our experiments:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Scalability for different interactions.
  \item Network characteristics.
  \item Bottlenecks.
  \item User study.
  \item Hardware and software specification.
\end{enumerate}

As we mentioned before, we will evaluate the performance of the system when we translate, scale and select nodes in the network. We will focus on the number of nodes and lines that the network has to have an idea of how the network scales. While studying the performance we will also see if there are bottlenecks and what is causing them. We will describe in Table \ref{tab:network-elements} the elements of the system that can more impact in the scalability.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l p{9cm}}
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Description} \\
Clusters & The algorithm used to create the clusters is run in the initialization of the system, before everything renders. This can be time consuming because it involves many operations to process the text files (they have several thousands of lines). However this is only called at the beginning and not after the system is initialized. \\
Nodes   & Represented as 2D squares in the space, they consist of 2 triangles. They are always showing in the scene and they position change while scaling and translating the network.  \\
Lines & They represent relationships between the nodes. Everytime a node is selected, line objects are added to the scene. They are 2-dimensional and consist of 2 triangles. Depending on the node we might need to render several hundreds of these lines in the scene. \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Elements of the network that have influence in the scalability.}
\label{tab:network-elements}
\end{table}

We have designed a series of experiments that can be reapeated several times. In our case we run each experiment 4 times and calculate the average. We also created a benchmark in Unity using C\# where we reproduce the interactions that we want to evaluate. The experiments are coded in the benchmark using scripts so that we can always reproduce them. For the networks translation and network scale we used mathematical functions to translate the network around the scene and to scale the network up and down. For the node selection we chose a set of nodes.

We ran the experiments in a machine with Windows 10. In Table \ref{tab:machine-specs} we can see some of the hardware specification from the machine used. The GPU from the machine is also specified in Table \ref{tab:gpu-specs}. The hardware specification of the Oculus Quest is shown in Table \ref{tab:oculus-specs}.

The experiments were run in Unity, the same software that was used for the development. The version of Unity used is 2018.4.10f1. Also OpenGL is used as the graphic API.

% @TODO Write about how scalability was tested.
In order to find bottlenecks, we used a profiling tool in Unity. A profiler is usually used to get an overview of the performance of the application. We used the built-in profiler in Unity. This gave us information about per-fram CPU  performance metrics. In addition, Unity also provides som metric information, that we can display in the Unity editor, like the number of vertices in the scene, triangles, frames per second, etc.

\section{Performance evaluation}
In this section we will explain the experiments that we run for the performance analysis. We will also show the results that we obtained and discuss them. As we mentioned before, we will focus on the performance for several actions that the user usually does when exploring the networks. These are translation of the network, scale up or down the network and select nodes in the network as well as render the lines for the relationships. All the experimens are run 4 times and we show the averages.

We ran all the experiments on the PC and we used the blood dataset from MIxT. We also ran each experiment for different sizes of the blood dataset: the whole dataset (2693 nodes), half size of the dataset (1346 nodes) and a third part (897 nodes). In order to analyse the performance, we obtained the deltaTime for each frame. In Unity, this variable privides the time between the current and previous frame. Once we obtain all the information we extract several information: the average of all the times, the 0.25\% worst and the 0.1\% worst of all the frames that the experiments last.

\subsection{Performance when translating the network}

 We will also remove the relationships for the nodes that doesn't exist anymore from the reduced datasets. In total we will run 9 experiments (3x3). Furthermore I will resume the data in 3 tables like Table \ref{tab:experiment_moving}, Table \ref{tab:experiment_scale} and Table \ref{tab:experiment_select}. Each table shows the data from the experiments for a specific action. The last column shows the average of the 25\% of the worst times (so the 25\% of the frames that have higher values). An alternative to the tables could be a bar graph.

As for how I will run the experiments, I want to create a script for each action. I want to create a script that moves the network, another script that scales up and down the network and a third one that selects a few nodes. We can select the 100 first frames an run the calculations for the percentages. This can be a tedious task if I have to do it manually, it would be better if I can do it programmatically (which I haven't seen a solution for so far).

I run the experiments three times and calculate the average. For translate and scale experiments I calculate the time frame for a range of 1000 frames, from frame 501 to frame 1500 inclusive.

% Draw calls: https://medium.com/@toncijukic/draw-calls-in-a-nutshell-597330a85381
% Basically a draw call contains all the information telling GPU about textures, states, shaders, rendering objects, buffers, etc. encapsulated as CPU work that prepares drawing resources for the graphics card. Converting state vectors (all the information mentioned before) to hardware commands for the GPU is very “expensive” for the CPU and API complexity becomes API overhead that does not help.

700 frames in total for all the experiments.

\subsection{Performance when selecting nodes}

The blood dataset has a total of 2693 nodes. Each node can have between 10 and thousands of edges with other nodes. The node with the name ARGLU1 has the highest number of edges, a total of 1607. In Figure \ref{fig:edges_nodes_blood} we show a scatter plot where the X axis represents the the number of edges in ascendent order and the Y axis represents the number of nodes that have that number of edges. As we can see, most of the nodes have less than 200 edges. But a few ones have several thousands. We have selected a few nodes for the experiments that cover nodes with lower number of edges to higher number of edges.
The nodes are: TGFBR3 (1), EPSTI1(11), SMNDC1(90), HNRNPH3(290), ANGEL2(586), ACTR6(756), FOPNL(1145), ARGLU1(1607).

\section{Scalability evaluation}

Once we see that the selecion of the nodes (including drawing the lines) has more impact in the performance and that it can create bottlenecks, we can evaluate the scalability of the line drawing. For this I can create an experiment where I measure the time that it takes to draw the lines for the selection of 15 nodes (20 can be too many for the graph). I can do three versions of this experiment where I scale the number of relationships by 2 and 3 times. I can also show the number of lines that are drawn for each node.

I can create a linear graph for this, like the one I showed (See Figure \ref{fig:graph_scalability}). I would also like to show the number of lines that each node renders. Maybe I can show this in the x axis. Any suggestion?

\section{Demo and interview}
One of the questions that we asked ourselves during the evaluation process was about the comfortability of using BigNext VR to explore a biological network. This is an important aspect when building VR applications. Some of the aspects to take into account are for instance the motion sickness or the intuitiveness. In order to evaluate this we made a questionnaire for bioinformaticians that would test the application. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 situtation\cite{covid_19}, we were not able to carry out the questionnaire with people. The reason is because it wasn't possible to test GeneNet VR with people on a single Oculus Quest device without avoiding the social distancing rules.
We estimated to have around 10 participants with knowdledge in bioinformatics to test the application. With this number of participants we could have made some statistics and obtained feedback for future improvement.

The following questionnaire is divided in four sections; a general section about VR headsets, a section about comfortability exploring the network using GeneNet VR, a section about the different actions in GeneNet VR and finally a section about feedback.

To complete the questionnaire, the teste has to indicate the level of agreement or disagreement with each of the  statements, mark yes or no when it is asked and in the feedback section reply the questions with constructive feedback if possible.\\
