Questions to answer in the evaluation chapter:

% Benchmarking in Unity
% https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/09/25/performance-benchmarking-in-unity-how-to-get-started/
% Maybe try VRWorks https://developer.nvidia.com/vrworks

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{How big can the graph be so that it is comfortable visualizing the network?}\\
  What is comfortable? Number of FPS?
  How can we scale the graph? By adding nodes and spread them around, by adding more interconnexions?
  Should the experiment split in several parts? Scaling, filtering, moving around, etc.
  What is the performance by using Oculus Link and the performance using just the Quest hardware?
  -We can use the Unity GPU Profiler for Oculus Quest and Go in order to see the performance.\\

  \item{How is this way of visualizing the graph better by using VR?}\\
  We are researchging the technology and the test with actual users is for future work.
  \item{In what way can the application and the visualization of the graph be improved?}\\
  Argue in the discussion part.

\section{Experimental setup}
@TODO Write about the specs of the system being used for the evaluation: the machine, software, etc.

\section{Testing scalability of the system}
@TODO Write about how scalability was tested.
A test scene was built in order to test de network and the scalability of it. A random network is built and we test how comfortable it is to navigate through it. This is measured by the FPS rate.
