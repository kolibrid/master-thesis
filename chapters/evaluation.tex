% Questions to answer in the evaluation chapter:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item{How big can the graph be so that it is comfortable visualizing the network?}\\
%   What is comfortable? Number of FPS?
%   How can we scale the graph? By adding nodes and spread them around, by adding more interconnexions?
%   Should the experiment split in several parts? Scaling, filtering, moving around, etc.
%   What is the performance by using Oculus Link and the performance using just the Quest hardware?
%   -We can use the Unity GPU Profiler for Oculus Quest and Go in order to see the performance.\\

BigNet VR has been implemented to explore biological networks like the one from MIxT. In this chapter we will evaluate the scalability of the application for this type of networks. The following list shows the questions that were asked as part of the evaluation and that we will try to answer along this chapter:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How big can the biological network be so that it is comfortable to explore and visualize it?
  \item How can we scale the network?
  \item What is the performance by using Oculus Link and the performance using just the Quest hardware?
  \item How comfortable is it to explore a network?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental setup}
% @TODO Write about the specs of the system being used for the evaluation: the machine, software, etc.
We ran the experiments in a machine with Windows 10. In Table \ref{tab:machine-specs} we can see some of the hardware specification from the machine used:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Machine specification}                        \\
Processor   & Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1275 v6 @ 2.80GHz 3.79 GHz \\
RAM memory  & 64.0 GB                                            \\
System type & 64-bit Operating System
\end{tabular}
\caption{Machine specification.}

\end{table}

Since the GPU is important in this type of applications, we show the specs of the GPU used in Table \ref{tab:gpu-specs}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{GPU specification} \\
Adapter type   & NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \\
Chip Type  &  GeForce GTX 1080 Ti \\
DAC Type & Integrated RAMDAC \\
Available memory & 45025 MB
\end{tabular}
\caption{GPU specification.}

\end{table}

% @TODO Write about Oculus quest hardware

As for the VR headset hardware, we used a Oculus Quest. In Table \ref{tab:oculus-specs} we can see the hardware specifications for this type of headset.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Oculus Quest specifications} \\

GPU & Qualcomm® Adreno™ 540 GPU \\
Memory & 4GB total
\end{tabular}

\section{Performance of the system}
% @TODO Write about how scalability was tested.
A test scene was built in order to test the network and the scalability of it. A random network is built and we test how comfortable it is to navigate through it. This is measured by the FPS rate.

VR profiling is a technique used to get an overview of the performance of our application. This is usually done in order to find bottlenecks so that we can eliminate them and improve the application's performance.

According to Oculus' performance baselines\cite{oculus_performance_baselines}, an application should meet the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 72 FPS for Oculus Quest (required by Oculus).
  \item 50-100 draw calls per frame.
  \item 50,000-100,000 triangles or vertices per frame.
\end{itemize}

To profile the application we used the built-in profiler in Unity, the software used for the development. The Unity Profiler gives information about per-fram CPU and GPU performance metrics.

\section{Scalability of the system}

\section{Questionnaire to evaluate the system}
One of the questions that we asked ourselves during the evaluation process was about the comfortability of using BigNext VR to explore a biological network. This is an important aspect when building VR applications. Some of the aspects to take into account are for instance the motion sickness or the intuitiveness. In order to evaluate this we made a questionnaire for bioinformaticians that would test the application. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 situtation\cite{covid_19}, we were not able to carry out the questionnaire with people. The reason is because it wasn't possible to test BigNet VR with people on a single Oculus Quest device without avoiding the social distancing rules.
We estimated to have around 10 participants with knowdledge in bioinformatics to test the application. With this number of participants we could have made some statistics and obtained feedback for future improvement.

The following questionnaire is divided in four sections; a general section about VR headsets, a section about comfortability exploring the network using BigNet VR, a section about the different actions in BigNet VR and finally a section about feedback.

To complete the questionnaire, the teste has to indicate the level of agreement or disagreement with each of the  statements, mark yes or no when it is asked and in the feedback section reply the questions with constructive feedback if possible.\\
