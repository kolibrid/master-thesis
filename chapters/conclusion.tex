We have developed GeneNet VR, a Virtual Reality application for the visualization of large biological networks. We used two datasets from MIxT, a real application with visualization problems, as a case study and solved scalability and information overload problems. GeneNet VR gives bioinformaticians the possibility to explore large biological networks for pattern finding using the Oculus Quest, a standalone cheap VR headset.

Previous work for the visualization of large biological networks has shown common problems like the hairball problem, cumbersome interactions and scalability issues. We solve these in GeneNet VR by taking advantage of the rich interactivity that VR offers in order to balance out the amount of information. We have implemented several interaction and visualization techniques that help the users explore the large datasets. A locomotion system is used, providing the user a way to move around in the scene, solving also object occlusion problems common in 3D spaces. The user can also move the network around, zoom in it and filter the nodes using a 2-dimensional UI. The edges of the network are shown for each node when the user selects them using a laser pointer. Also, a novel feature allows the users compare two datasets in real time. We demonstrate as well that the networks can be explored in cheap VR hardware by running a performance evaluation, which makes GeneNet VR light to use.

We ran several performance experiments for our case study and demonstrated that GeneNet VR has a good performance when exploring the networks from MIxT. We also evaluated several interactions that are commonly used during the visualization process and concluded that they achieved high FPS resuts. We learned from the experiments that the average frame time oscilates between 6.4 and 8.7 milliseconds, which is much lower than the limit from the Oculus guidelines (13.9 ms). We also compared the performance between the PC and the Oculus Quest hardware and the results indicated that the Oculus Quest is around 30\% slower, but it is still inside the required FPS.

Through several interviews with biologists and computer scientists from UiT, we got positive feedback, standing out that GeneNet VR is an interesting and usfeul tool to explore biological networks. The system is also easy to learn for the interviewees and the interactivity is smooth, making it easy to explore the networks and with potential to find novel patterns in them. We also made a list with further requirements that we extracted from the interviews that will help us improve GeneNet VR in the future.

We believe that GeneNet VR is an important and useful tool for bioinformaticians. We have traced out the guidelines that enable VR as an affordable and advantageous option for the visualization of large biological networks. The rich interactivity that VR offers and the advancement in hardware has allowed us to solve visualization and scalability problems that are common in similar visualization tools. Now we ask ourselves, what are the next steps of GeneNet VR? And also, can we use a similar solution to visualize similar networks from other fields? Thanks to the interviews that we carried out, we think that GeneNet VR has potential for future improvements and can definitely be useful in other fields, for example for the visualization of drug networks and social networks.
