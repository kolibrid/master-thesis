We have developed GeneNet VR, a virtual reality application for the visualization of genetic networks. We have used two datasets that contain genetic information that belong to a woman with breast cancer; one dataset from a tissue and another from a blood sample. These datasets come from the MIxT project (Matched Interaction Across Tissues), were they provide a network view in 2-dimensions for the visualization of the datasets. In GeneNet VR we move this network view to the virtual reality. It is 3-dimensional and we apply several VR techniques for the interactivity.
