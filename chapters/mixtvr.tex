In this chapter I will write about the implementation of the VR application using Unity3d.\\
The points that I want to cover are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Building the network from the bioinformatics data and clustering.
  \item Manipulation of the network: translation and scaling.
  \item Locomotion and ergonomics used in the VR environment.
  \item Changing from the blood network to the biopsy network and viceversa.
  \item Filtering genes in the network using gene sets that represent signatures of cellular pathways which are often dis-regulated in cancer.
\end{itemize}
